This package provides implementation of some common robot sensor models, their comparison against ground truth, and visualization.

To use this package, first launch turtlebot3 simulation
```
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo_simple turtlebot3_world.launch
```
Then, launch sensor model computation and visualization
```
roslaunch robot_sensor_model robot_sensor_model.launch
```
